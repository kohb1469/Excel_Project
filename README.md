# Excel_Project - An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Overview of Project

-Using Excel, I performed analysis on Kickstarter Data using many of Microsoft Excel's tools. I utilized Pivot Tables and different types of graphs to identify which subcategories and parent categories of the campaigns performed the best. Then, I used line graphs to identify seasonal/monthly trends within the Theatre campaigns.

## Analysis and Challenges

-Then using descriptive statistics, within the Goal and Money pledged column, I identified the outliers of Campaigns set in Great Britain that only involved musicals.
Louis's estimated budget for her future project in Great Britain was £4,000, but from the data, it can be shown that Lousie should try and get her play produced for less than £4,000 since half of the campagin goals are less than £2,000, which is just over the 3rd quartile for amounts pledged.
