# Excel_Project - An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
*Using Excel, I performed analysis on Kickstarter Data using many of Microsoft Excel's tools. I utilized Pivot Tables and different types of graphs to identify which subcategories and parent categories of the campaigns performed the best. Then, I used line graphs to identify seasonal/monthly trends within the Theatre campaigns.
